# COS 435 Final Project – Reproducing BRO in New Simulation Environment
_Princeton University, Spring 2025_

This repository contains the full code-base and experimental results for our COS 435 final project.  
The work is a joint effort by:

- **Donggeon Oh** — do9948@princeton.edu  
- **Richard Zhou** — rz3911@princeton.edu

## Overview

We implemented and evaluated two deep-RL algorithms:

1. **Soft Actor–Critic (SAC)**  
2. **Bigger Regularized Optimistic (BRO)**

We implemented both algorithms in **PyTorch**.  
All figures and results in this repository are generated by our code.

## Acknowledgements:

1. **SAC Implementation**
    - We implemented the SAC algorithm using the Assignment 7 skeleton code, the original SAC paper (Haarnoja et al., 2018 — https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905), and the PyTorch Discor implementation (https://github.com/toshikwa/discor.pytorch) as references.

2. **BRO Implementation**
    - To build the BRO algorithm on top of our SAC code, we consulted the original BRO paper (Nauman et al., 2024 — https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16158), its JAX implementation (https://github.com/naumix/BiggerRegularizedOptimistic), and the authors’ PyTorch port (https://github.com/naumix/BiggerRegularizedOtimistic_Torch). 
    - We note that the PyTorch port over-simplifies and diverges from both the paper and the JAX version.

3. **Originality**
    - We did not copy code from these open-source SAC or BRO repositories; they served only for insight and debugging. Neural network classes and update functions were implemented by us.
